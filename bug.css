The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error where a pseudo-element selector is used incorrectly within a nested selector, leading to unexpected styling results. The inner `::before` pseudo-element is not correctly targeting the element within the `li` context, leading to unexpected application of the style. This occurs because of a specificity issue where the `::before` selector on the more general element has higher specificity than the intended selector on the nested `li`.  This specific issue would only manifest in situations with nested lists or similar structures.
